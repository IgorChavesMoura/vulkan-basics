# Simple Vulkan Application

### This application is based on this amazing [tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Introduction)

### An application made for learning purposes, to get the Vulkan basics concepts like:
 - Surface
 - Picking physical device (the actual GPU)
 - Creating a logica device
 - Creating a swap chain
 - Creating image views
 - Creating queues to render and present images
 - Creating a render pass
 - Creating a SPIR-V shader from GLSL
 - Creating a graphics pipeline with shaders 
 - Creating framebuffers
 - Creating a command pool and command buffers
 - Creating sync objects to do GPU GPU sync and GPU CPU sync (Semaphores and Fences)

#### The goal of the application is to draw a triangle like this:


### Requirements to run the application
 - LunarG VulkanSDK
 - GLFW for GUI window
 - GLM for linear algebra operations
